# 🏦 Commercial Partnership & White-Labeling

MortaMe provides high-precision mortgage logic that banks and real estate agencies can leverage to build trust with clients. We offer two ways for professionals to use our platform:

## 1. Community Edition (Free)
You may share the MortaMe link or embed the tool in your site for free, provided:
* The header **"MortaMe. The Most Transparent Mortgage Simulator"** remains visible.
* The project links and branding are not hidden or altered.

## 2. Partner Edition (Paid/Commitment)
For institutions that require a seamless, branded experience, we offer a **White-Label Integration**.

### Features of the Partner Edition:
* **Custom Branding:** Your corporate logo replaces or sits alongside the MortaMe logo.
* **Custom Theming:** Optional adjustment of the primary color (e.g., Indigo to your brand color).
* **Unique URL:** Access the tool via `morta.me/?brand=your-bank-name`.
* **No "Support" CTA:** The donation/support links are removed from your branded view.

### How to Apply
To maintain the integrity of our financial logic, we require a minimum annual commitment or donation to the project for white-label use.

1.  **Contact us on GitHub** to discuss your specific needs:
